	<h2>About</h2>
	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	A website to facilitate the interview process and analysis of repertory grids.
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	This website uses <a href="https://openrepgrid.org/">OpenRepGrid</a>, and FileSaver, SheetJS, and TableExport.
	<h3>What's the deal with the analysis?</h3>
	Currently, the infrastructure is not set up to allow customization. In the future, it will. In the meantime, I recommend using OpenRepGrid, which this website uses for analysis.
